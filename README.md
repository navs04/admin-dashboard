# admin-dashboard
A static Admin Dashboard prototype built with HTML and CSS, with a deliberate focus on CSS Grid for the page layout and component grids.
This repository is a learning exercise in building dashboard-style layouts, organizing UI components using grid + flexbox, and creating reusable card components.
This project is part of an exercise to practice front-end layout techniques.

The dashboard includes:

- Sidebar navigation
- Header with search, user info and action buttons
- Projects section with cards and icons
- Announcements panel
- Trending creators panel

# Learning Goals

This project focused on:

- Building complex layouts using CSS Grid
- Using nested grid + flex combinations
- Positioning icons and text cleanly
- Designing reusable UI blocks
- Creating dashboard-style UI components

# Future Enhancements

Ideas for adding more functionality:

- Add interactivity using JavaScript
- Make the layout fully responsive
- Add dark mode / light mode switch
- Dynamic user/project data using JSON
